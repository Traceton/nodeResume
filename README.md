### :rocket: This portfolio is a node.js app, which hosts my personal portfolio. It used express, express-session, mongoose, ejs, and bcrypt.
Features a basic user-authentication.
It is connected to a mongoDB atlas database, stores the usernames and hashed(using bcrypt) passwords, and when the user logs in or creates a account, the app checks if the user exists, and than either logs in or creates a new user account accordlingly.
